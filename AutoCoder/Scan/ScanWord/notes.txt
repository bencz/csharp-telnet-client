... LineLocation .... ---------------- location of a line in a string -----------------------------

    class LineLocation
		  {
			  public LineIdentifier LineId ;
				public int StartIndex ;
		}
		
		// stores the start location of each line within a text stream.     

... Verbatim string .... ---------- scan for words on line containing verbatime string ------------------

  when splitting a string into words, process quoted strings as individual words.

	in the case where a quoted string continues onto the next line ( verbatim string 
	literals in c# ):
	  - return from ScanNextWord method with continuation needed indicator.
		- caller should repeat the call with the next line concatenated onto the
		  end of the scan string. ( new line between the two strings )
		- provider an array of LineLocation
